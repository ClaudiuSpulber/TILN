          Summary-The      NE0 Personality Inventory (NEO-PI) is intended to operationahze the five-factor model
          of personality, both at the level of broad factors or domains and at the level of more specific traits or
          facets of each domain. However, only facets of three of the domains are currently measured. In this paper
          we describe minor modifications to the facet scales of Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Openness, and the
          development of new scales to measure facets of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Conceptual
          distinctions within these domains were suggested by a review of the literature, and pilot studies provided
          preliminary evidence for the validity of new facet scales. Item analyses in a large and diverse sample
          (n = 1539) of adult men and women were used to finalize item selection and to confirm the structure of
          the Revised NEO-PI (NEO-PIR) at both the item and the scale level. Correlations of the NEO-PIR with
          a variety of other self-report scales in a second sample of 394 men and women provided evidence on
          the convergent and discriminant validity of scales to measure Trust, Straightforwardness, Altruism,
          Compliance, Modesty and Tender-Mindedness as facets of Agreeableness, and Competence, Order,
          Dutifulness, Achievement Striving, Self-Discipline, and Deliberation as facets of Conscientiousness.


There is growing agreement among personality psychologists from many different perspectives that,
at the broadest level, there are five major dimensions of personality (Digman, 1990; John, 1990;
Hogan, 1987; Wiggins & Trapnell, in press). The five factors of Neuroticism (N), Extraversion (E),
Openness to Experience (0), Agreeableness (A), and Conscientiousness (C) have been recovered
in self-reports and ratings, in studies of adults and children, in a variety of theoretically based
questionnaires, and in the analysis of adjectives from several different languages.
   These broad factors are defined by more narrow traits (or facets; Costa & McCrae, in press),
and Briggs (1989) has recently argued that psychologists should explore these lower-level traits, for
two reasons: (1) because they provide a clearer conceptual basis for the five broad factors; and
(2) because they themselves mark important individual differences. For example, two individuals
with identical extraversion scores may differ strikingly in their profiles on specific facets of E, and
these differences may be significant in many contexts. The specific variance associated with
individual traits may have predictive utility, as shown by Mershon and Gorsuch (1988).
   Conceptually, the nature of the factors can be determined from the individual adjectives
(Goldberg, 1990) or homogeneous item clusters (Hogan, 1986) that define them, but no published
instrument routinely provides scores on facets of all five factors. The Revised Interpersonal
Adjective Scales-Big Five (IASR-BS) of Trapnell and Wiggins (1990) measure eight traits that form
the interpersonal circumplex and specify elements of A and E, but provide only global measures
of N, 0, and C. The NE0 Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1985, 1989a) has facet scales
for N, E, and 0, but not for A and C. This paper introduces new scales to measure facets of these
latter domains.
   The consensus on the five-factor model does not extend to the level of facet traits (Briggs, 1989).
The body of trait terms in the English language provided a useful guide to broad factors, but many
important distinctions that trait psychologists make have not been encoded in lay adjectives
(McCrae, 1990), so analyses of adjectives are unlikely to be sufficient for the identification of facets.

At present, it appears that the best basis for specifying facets A and C is an analysis of the
psychological literature. Although the facets proposed are not the only possible ones, they should
mark an advance over global scales, and research using these new facet scales may lead eventually
to improved conceptualizations.
   Our approach to the development of A and C facet scales parallels earlier work on N, E, and 0
(Costa & McCrae, 1978, 1980). We identified six facet scales for each domain, not because each
is natually divisible into six parts, but because at least six distinctions were suggested by the
literature, and more than six scales would tax the user’s ability to learn and remember the facets.
For each domain, we sought to identify traits that were familiar through previous theory and
measurement, roughly comparable in breadth, and maximally distinct from each other.

                 CONCEPTUALIZING  FACETS OF AGREEABLENESS
                           AND CONSCIENTIOUSNESS

   The process of conceptualizing facets involves identifying as many relevant constructs as possible
and then grouping them into categories. Items can then be written to tap the proposed facets, and
item analyses provide empirical tests of the proposed conceptual distinctions. A conceptual analysis
of Agreeableness has been published (Costa, McCrae & Dembroski, 1989); an early analysis of
Conscientiousness (as self-control) was offered by McCrae (1976). This section summarizes our
current view of the facets and traces their origins in the psychological literature.

Agreeableness
   Agreeableness, like Extraversion, is primarily a dimension of interpersonal behavior; but whereas
E is chiefly related to the preferred quantity of social stimulation, A represents the characteristic
quality of interaction “along a continuum from compassion to antagonism” (Costa & McCrae,
1985, p. 2). This dimension is perhaps most familiar in its role as one of the defining axes of the
interpersonal circumplex (McCrae & Costa, 1989) but A is revealed in more than interpersonal
behavior. Agreeableness also influences the self-image and helps to shape social attitudes and
philosophy of life. We have identified Trust, Straightforwardness, Altruism, Compliance, Modesty,
and Tender-Mindedness as facets of A.
   Trust can be defined as the tendency to attribute benevolent intent to others; distrust as the
suspicion that others are dishonest or dangerous. Trust is a classic personality variable, seen by
Erikson (1950) as the foundation of psychosocial development, and by Wrightsman (1974) as one
of the major definers of each individual’s philosophy of human nature. Trust is also an important
element of lay conceptions of personality. When Norman classified 1431 English-language trait
descriptive adjectives into 75 categories (Goldberg, 1989) the first category assigned to the
Agreeableness factor was called Trust. Low standing on this facet is associated with cynicism.
   Straightforwardness implies directness and frankness in dealing with others. This variable is far
more important in moral philosophy than it has been in personality psychology, although one
version of its opposite pole, Machiavellianism (Geis, 1978), was a popular concept in the 1970s.
The concept of Self-monitoring (Snyder, 1974) also involves low Straightforwardness. Wiggins
(1979) identified a similar dimension of the Interpersonal Circumplex contrasting Ingenuous with
Calculating.
   Altruism is selflessness and concern for others, and as a concept it has figured prominently
in recent social psychology, but also in the classic personality theory of Adler (1964), who
called it ‘social interest’. Norman’s categories contrast Generosity and Altruism with Greed;
Murray’s (1938) need for Nurturance is probably also related. The word ‘altruism’ sometimes
suggests conspicuous self-sacrifice; here it is also intended to cover more mundane courtesy and
consideration.
   Compliance is an interpersonal style that is seen when conflicts arise; compliant individuals defer
to others instead of fighting; they are meek and mild. In a positive sense, this trait is seen in a
willingness to cooperate that Norman called Agreeableness and Digman and Inouye (1986) called
Friendly Compliance. The opposite, aggressive, pole is better known: Anger Expression is a major
part of Buss and Durkee’s (I 957) Hostility Inventory; Quarrelsomeness was one of Wiggins’ (1979)
IAS variables (although it was omitted from the revision of the IAS); and aggression is a key
                                Facets of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness                         889


concept in social psychology, psychiatry, and even ethology. Vindictiveness, Antagonism, and
Aggressiveness are the corresponding Norman categories.
  Modesty, or humility, refers to an aspect of the self-concept. Modest people are not preoccupied
with themselves; arrogant people have an inflated view of themselves. Murray (1938) identified a
need for Abasement, and Wiggins (1979) contrasted Arrogant with Unassuming traits. The clinical
concept of Narcissism refers to a pathologically extreme lack of modesty.
  Tender-Mindedness     refers to the tendency to be guided by feelings, particularly those of
sympathy, in making judgments and forming attitudes. The term was originated by William James,
and this dimension is also akin to Eysenck’s (1954) T dimension in political and social attitudes.
The Thinking-Feeling index of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI; Myers & McCaulley,
1985) measures a related construct. Eysenck and Eysenck (1975) have suggested the use of the term
‘Tough-minded’ to refer to their Psychoticism dimension, and Scale I of the 16PF (Cattell, Eber
& Tatsuoka, 1970) is also called Tender-Mindedness, but both these constructs are considerably
broader than our conception of Tender-Mindedness.

Conscientiousness
   As an aspect of character, Conscientiousness was studied by Hartshorn, May and Maller (1929);
as an aspect of ego strength, it was described by Murray and Kluckhohn (1953) using such terms
as will power, initiative, and responsibility. Tellegen and Waller (in press) have identified the related
dimension of Constraint. We conceptualize C as having both proactive and inhibitive aspects, and
once favored the term Direction as the name of the domain, because it implied both movement
and focus. The proactive side of Conscientiousness is seen most clearly in the need for achievement
and commitment to work; the inhibitive side is seen in moral scrupulousness and cautiousness. The
proposed facets of C are Competence, Order, Dutifulness, Achievement Striving, Self-Discipline,
and Deliberation.
    By Competence we mean the sense that one is capable, sensible, and accomplished. The concept
is chiefly known from White’s (1959) essay on the topic; a sense of competence is a major
component of some versions of self-esteem (e.g. O’Brien & Epstein, 1974). Many lexical studies
show that some aspects of rated or self-reported intelligence (e.g. logical, foresighted vs thoughtless,
imperceptive) also load on a Conscientiousness factor (McCrae, 1990); we view these as reflections
of Competence. We would also hypothesize that locus of control would be related to this facet.
   Order, the tendency to keep one’s environment tidy and well organized, is familiar from several
personality inventories: Orderly is one of the scales of Lorr’s (1986) Interpersonal Style Inventory
(ISI) in the Self-Control cluster. Order was one of Murray’s needs, and one of Norman’s categories.
Pathological forms of Order are seen in compulsive behavior.
   Dutifulness refers to strict adherence to standards of conduct; it is seen in Norman’s Reliability
category. Freudian concepts of superego strength are also related, and this is probably the facet
of C closest to Cattell’s G factor. Dutifulness should not be equated with moral development or
reasoning (Rest, 1979); it does not concern the origin or sophistication of moral principles, only
the extent to which principles or standards are observed.
   Digman and Inouye (1986) preferred to call C ‘Will to Achieve’, and Achievement Striving is
one of our facets of C. Need for achievement is perhaps the most widely researched of Murray’s
needs, and our view of this trait is consistent with the classical definition of Achievement as a
striving for’excellence. Some versions of the Type A construct emphasize excessive achievement
motivation (Rosenman, Brand, Jenkins, Friedmn, Straus & Wurm, 1975), although there is now
convincing evidence that high need for Achievement is not a risk factor for coronary disease
(Matthews & Haynes, 1986).
   We view Self-discipline primarily in terms of persistence, the ability to continue with a task
despite boredom or other distractions (compare Lorr’s Persistent scale). Individuals low in
Self-discipline are prone to procrastination, and they quickly give up when faced with frustration.
Self-discipline is one aspect of self-control, but self-control is a broader construct which also
includes aspects of Neuroticism. A factor analysis of self-control scales (McCrae & Costa, 1985b)
suggested that the inhibition of urges and impulses (to eat, smoke, spend money) is more closely
related to N than to C, and Impulsiveness in the NEO-PI is a facet of N. Self-Discipline refers to a
more proactive perseverance in tasks that are not immediately appealing, and is an element of C.

  Finally, Deliberation means caution, planning, and thoughtfulness. This facet can be contrasted
with Buss and Plomin’s (1975) Quick Decision Time and with some of the more cognitive
conceptions of reflection-impulsivity  (Kagan, 1966). Lorr included Deliberate among his ISI
Self-Control scales.

                        SCALE    DEVELOPMENT:              PILOT   STUDIES

First pilot study: A and C facet scales
   Based on these conceptualizations,    152 items were written to measure the 12 A and C facets.
These items were intended to supplement the 36 A and C items in the current NEO-PI, with equal
numbers of positively and negatively keyed items for each proposed facet. We will refer to these
a priori scales as the Phase I facets. The 188 items were administered to a sample of 93 men, aged
32-91, and 123 women, aged 28-82 (Costa & McCrae, 1989b). The Ss, who were described by
McCrae and Costa (1987), were initially recruited as peer raters for participants in the Baltimore
Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA; Shock, Greulich, Andres, Arenberg, Costa, Lakatta & Tobin,
1984). In 1986 they provided self-report data on the NEO-PI, the Personality Research Form
(Jackson, 1984), and the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory; in 1987 they completed the Millon
Clinical Multiaxial Inventory (MCMI; Millon, 1983) and the California Psychological Inventory
(CPI; Gough, 1987), as well as the Phase I facets. As in the NEO-PI, items were answered on a
five-point Likert scale from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’.
   Analyses of these data generally supported the conceptual model of the facets. Joint factor
analysis of the Phase I scales and NEO-PI scales showed that 10 of the 12 scales had their highest
loading on the appropriate factor. A series of item analyses were then undertaken to select the best
eight items for each facet. Items more highly related to unintended factors were eliminated, and
item factor analyses were then conducted within A and C item pools separately. These analyses
supported the conceptual distinctions among the facets, and led to the development of Phase II
scales composed of the original 36 A and C items and 60 of the new trial items.
   Estimates of internal consistency for thePhase II scales ranged from 0.64 for Tender-Mindedness
to 0.84 for Self-Discipline; Coefficient alpha for the 48-item Agreeableness score formed by
summing the Phase II facets was 0.88; for Conscientiousness, it was 0.92. Correlations of the facets
with the MCMI Personality Disorder Scales, the PRF Needs, the revised CPI scales, and the
Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory scales showed preliminary evidence of convergent and discrimi-
nant validity (Costa & McCrae, 1990; McCrae, Costa & Piedmont, submitted). For example, Trust
was negatively related to BDHI Suspicion, Compliance was negatively related to PRF Aggression,
and Modesty was negatively related to PRF Exhibition (all Ps <O.OOl). There were strong
correlations between Order and PRF Order (r = 0.71), Achievement Striving and PRF Achieve-
ment (r = 0.59) and Deliberation and PRF Cognitive Structure (r = 0.43).

Second pilot study: revisions of N, E, and 0 facets
   The addition of A and C facet scales provided an opportunity to revise the existing N, E, and
0 facet scales. Since publication in 1985, it has become clear that a few items were misplaced. For
example, the item ‘Others think of me as being modest and unassuming’ is currently scored as (low)
Assertiveness; it is now clear that it is better thought of as a Modesty item. A few other items
showed low item-total correlations. To refine the N, E, and 0 facet scales, a second pilot study
was conducted using volunteers from the BLSA and their spouses.
   In 1990, 222 men aged 29-96, and 172 women aged 23-93 completed a 120-item questionnaire
that consisted of the 60 new Phase II A and C facet items, 36 additional A and C trial items,
and-of particular concern here-24 trial N, E, and 0 items. The Ss had previously completed
the NEO-PI in 1986 (Costa & McCrae, 1988); a joint analysis of the items from the two
administrations was conducted. A conservative item selection strategy was adopted: to replace a
NEO-PI item, the proposed new item had to show better convergent and discriminant validity with
NEO-PI scales despite the fact that it was administered 4yr later. Ten items met this criterion,
leading to changes of two items each for the Hostility, Gregariousness, and Assertiveness scales
and of one item each for the Activity, Excitement Seeking, and Openness to Feelings and Actions
scales. These 10 changes substantially improved the factor structure of the facets.

                                              STUDY       1
Method
   Subjects. As part of a study of job performance predictors, 1825 men and women employed by
a large national organization were administered the NEO-PI and supplementary items. Of these,
1760 (96%) had complete and valid personality data; however, 221 Ss did not specify sex, and so
were excluded from the analyses. The final sample of 1539 included 543 men and 996 women. Most
of the Ss (7 1.1% of the men and 68.3% of the women) were white, but a substantial minority were
black (16.4% of the men and 22.8% of the women). Half of the women and three-quarters of the
men had college degrees; virtually all Ss were high-school graduates. The men ranged in age from
21 to 63 (M = 32.3, SD = 8.8); the women from 21 to 64 (M = 33.4, SD = 9.2). This sample is thus
considerably younger, had less formal education, and is more racially diverse than the BLSA
samples on which the NEO-PI was developed.
   Measures and procedure. The NE0 Personality Inventory (NEO-PI; Costa & McCrae, 1985,
1989a) is a 181-item questionnaire developed through rational and factor analytic methods to
measure the five-factor model of personality. Scales are balanced to control for the effects of
acquiescence, and a series of studies have shown that scores are not strongly influenced by socially
desirable responding when administered to volunteers (e.g. McCrae & Costa, 1983). Scales show
adequate internal consistency and are stable over a 6-year period (Costa & McCrae, 1988). The
instrument has been reviewed by Hogan (1989) and Leong and Dollinger (1990). Subjects were also
administered the 120-item questionnaire used in the second pilot study which included trial items
for revising N, E, and 0 facet scales and items intended to measure facets of A and C. The two
instruments were combined and completed by Ss during time provided by their employer. Subjects
were assured that responses would remain confidential, and that results would have no effect on
their job evaluation.
   Subjects were also administered the Janis-Field Self-Esteem scale (Robinson & Shaver, 1973)
the Rotter (1966) Locus of Control scale, and six scales from the Revised CPI (Gough, 1987):
Capacity for Status, Social Presence, Self-Acceptance, Achievement via Conformance, Achieve-
ment via Independence, and Work Orientation. These scales were used as criteria to examine
validity of the NEO-PIR scales in this sample.

Results and discussion
   Items from the Phase II A and C scales were supplemented by 36 new trial A and C items and
four items previously assigned to facets of N and E. Factor analyses were conducted separately
for A and C items, extracting and rotating six factors in each case. To control for acquiescent
responding, an index was created by summing all 300 items in the combined inventories without
regard for keying direction; this index was partialled from the item correlation matrix before
factoring in all the item analyses reported here. These analyses were generally consistent with the
intended structure of the facets: five of the six proposed A facets and five of the six proposed C
facets were recovered. (The exceptions were Straightforwardness and Self-Discipline, which were
related to several of the obtained factors.) Final, Phase III, item selection was based on (a) factor
loadings in this analysis and in subsequent analyses on reduced sets of items; (b) the mandatory
inclusion of items used in the short form of the NEO-PI, the NE0 Five-Factor Inventory; and
(c) the requirement that no more than six of the eight items on any scale be keyed in the same
direction. These considerations led to changes of l-3 items on 10 of the A and C facet scales; no
changes were made for Trust or Achievement Striving.
   Because the NEO-PI has been extensively validated and the Phase II A and C scales have shown
preliminary evidence of validity, the correlations between the original scales and the corresponding
revised scales are of interest in establishing    the validity of the latter. The revised scales were
therefore correlated with the original NEO-PI and Phase II scales. For the seven N, E, and 0 facet
scales with item changes suggested by the second pilot study, these equivalence correlations ranged
between 0.93 and 0.95; for the 10 A and C facet scales that were changed, the correlations ranged
from 0.78 to 0.97 (median = 0.88). When the original NEO-PI domain scores were correlated with
the new domain scores, the equivalence correlations were 1.0, 0.99, 0.99, 0.84, and 0.89 for N, E,
0, A, and C, respectively. The very high correlations for the N, E, and 0 domains reflect the fact
892                                        PAUL T. COSTA JR et al.


 that the great majority of items in the two versions are the same; however, because the original
 A and C domain scales contain only 18 items whereas the revised scales contain 48 items, the A
 and C correlations cannot be attributed solely to item overlap.
    The Revised NEO-PI (NEO-PIR) consists of 240 items that define 30 eight-item facet scales
 grouped into five domains. Would an item factor analysis recover these scales? It should be noted
 that although the present sample was used in the selection of A and C items, it was not used in
 the selection of N, E, or 0 items, and thus constitutes a strict cross-validation sample for the latter
 domains. When five Varimax factors were extracted, they correspond to the hypothesized factors;
 the correlations of the factor scores with the corresponding domain scale scores were 0.91, 0.89,
 0.95, 0.95, and 0.89, respectively, for N, E, 0, A, and C.
    Item analysis at the facet level is a much more stringent test of the model, because five groups
 of six correlated factors are hypothesized, each with only eight single-item markers. When 30
 Varimax factors were examined from the 240-item matrix, three were broad factors representing
 N, C, and a combination of E and A items. Even in this analysis, however, 15 of the facet scales
 were clearly recovered, with correlations between facet scales and factor scores of 0.66-0.90.
    Orthogonal Procrustes analysis (Schbnemann, 1966) may offer a more reasonable approach to
 determining the degree of consistency between the hypothesized and observed item structures. In
 this analysis, the 30 Varimax factors were rotated to a target of Is, - Is, and OS,based on the item
 scoring key. This rotation showed an excellent fit. A total of 206 of the 240 items had their largest
 loading on the intended factor, including a majority of items from each facet scale. For the 48-item
 domain scales, 39 N items, 40 E items, 45 0 items, 41 A items and 41 C items had their largest
 loading on the intended factor. The 30 convergent correlations between the factors and correspond-
 ing facet scale scores ranged from 0.54 to 0.89, with a median of 0.72; by contrast, the largest of
 the 870 discriminant correlations was 0.34. It appears that the fine-grained conceptual distinctions
 embodied in the NEO-PIR facets are consistent with the factor structure of the items.
    Coefficient alphas for the domain scales in the full sample were 0.92, 0.89, 0.87, 0.86. and 0.90,
 respectively, for N, E, 0, A, and C. Reliabilities for the facet scales are given in Table 1; they range
 from 0.56 to 0.81, with a median of 0.71. For eight-item scales, these are reasonable values. The
 relatively low values for the Tender-Mindedness and Compliance facets of A suggest that particular
 attention will be needed in the validation of these scales in Study 2.
    Table 1 also presents the results of a factor analysis of the 30 facet scales. Five principal
 components had eigenvalues greater than 1.0 and together accounted for 58% of the variance; a
 scree test clearly indicated the presence of five factors. After Varimax rotation, all facet scales have
 their highest loading on the intended factor. Despite the fact that all facets could be distinguished
 in a factor analysis of the items, they clearly covary at a broader level to form the five factors. There
 are six large secondary loadings, but all are understandable: for example, the loadings of Activity
 on C, Altruism on E, and Hostility on A reflect the facts that conscientious people keep busy, that
extraverts are friendly and helpful, and that disagreeable people are often angry.
    The size and diverse composition of this sample makes it possible to examine the replicability
 of this factor structure across different groups. Because most research on the NEO-PI has employed
samples that are predominantly white, older adults, it is of particular interest to examine the factor
 structure in young adult (i.e. 21-29 years) and non-white subsamples. Separate factor analyses were
conducted for men and women, for younger (n = 708) and older (n = 823) Ss, and for white
 (n = 1042) and non-white (n = 462) Ss, and factor congruence coefficients (Wrigley & Neuhaus,
 1955) were calculated between each contrasted pair. Of these 15 coefficients, 14 were 0.95 or above;
the 15th, for the A factor in whites vs non-whites, was 0.91.
    Previous analyses have shown factorial invariance for the N, E, and 0 facet scales across age
and sex groups (e.g. McCrae & Costa, 1983), but this is the first demonstration of the factorial
validity of the NEO-PI in a non-white sample. It is perhaps not surprising that the factor structure
of the NEO-PIR is so robust: it was developed on the basis of a large body of research which has
recovered the five-factor model of personality in several different cultures, languages, and age
groups. Factorial invariance in the NEO-PI is a necessary, though not sufficient, criterion for
judging the success with which the instrument reflects the model.
    Some evidence of validity of the NEO-PIR scales is given in Table 2, which shows correlations
with other scales administered to this sample. Self-esteem is strongly, and predictably, related to

low N, high E, and high C (compare McCrae & Costa, 1988). Among the A and C facets, it is
most highly correlated (as hypothesized) with Competence, r = 0.59, and with Self-Discipline,
r = 0.50, and Achievement Striving, r = 0.41. External Locus of Control scores are related to N
and low C. All six of the C facet scales are significantly negatively related to Locus of Control,
but, as hypothesized, the association is strongest with the Competence facet of C, r = -0.29.
   Correlations with the CPI scales generally replicate findings reported elsewhere (McCrae,
Costa & Piedmont, submitted). As in that study, Capacity for Status, Social Presence, and
Self-Acceptance are chiefly related to E and 0; Achievement via Conformance to low N and high
C; and Achievement via Independence to 0. Work Orientation, which was not examined in the
earlier study, is related chiefly to low N and high A and C in the present sample. Of these six scales,
Achievement via Conformance and Work Orientation are most relevant to the evaluation of A and
C facets. Achievement via Conformance is strongly and appropriately related to Competence,
Dutifulness, Achievement, and Self-Discipline, rs = 0.40-0.49; Work Orientation is related chiefly
to the Trust facet of A, r = 0.41, and the Competence facet of C, r = 0.42.

                                               STUDY      2

   It is necessary to have external criteria to evaluate the convergent and discriminant validity of
the new A and C facet scales, and the archives of the BLSA offer a number of relevant and useful
criteria, including several standard personality questionnaires. Study 2 examines the relations of
the new facet scales to these instruments. In addition, we consider correlations among the five
domain scales.

Method
   Subjects. The 394 BLSA participants and spouses from the second pilot study for the selection
of new N, E, and 0 items served as Ss in this study. It should be noted that these Ss were not
involved in the selection of A and C facet items. BLSA participants are generally healthy,
predominantly white, well-educated, community-dwelling adults (Shock et al., 1984). All are
volunteers who have agreed to periodic psychological and biomedical testing; over the past 30 yr
they have provided data on a wide variety of instruments.
   Measures. Participants completed the NEO-PI in 1986 and the additional 120 items administered
in Study 1 in 1990; item responses were pooled to score the A and C facets. Domain scales for
A and C are calculated by summing the facet scales for each. Between 1960 and 1978 men in the
BLSA completed the Guilford-Zimmerman        Temperament Survey (GZTS; Guilford, Zimmerman
& Guilford, 1976) while visiting the Gerontology Research Center. Between 1979 and 1987 both
male and female participants completed a variety of questionnaires at home and returned them by
mail. These included the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI; Eysenck & Eysenck, 1964) and a new
scale developed by the Eysencks to measure Psychoticism (see McCrae & Costa, 1985a); the
Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI; Myers & McCaulley, 1985); the Adjective Check List (Gough
& Heilbrun, 1983), from which the 15 Murray need scales were scored; the Sensation Seeking Scales
V (SSS-V; Zuckerman, 1979); the Revised Interpersonal Adjective Checklist (Wiggins, Trapnell &
Phillips, 1988); and the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI; Buss & Durkee, 1957).

Results   and discussion
   Tables 3 and 4 present correlations between Agreeableness and Conscientiousness domain and
facet scales and the criterion scales. Only criterion scales with at least one correlation of 0.30 or
greater in absolute magnitude are reported in the tables. Among the scales that showed no
correlation this large with any of the A or C scales were EPI Neuroticism, GZTS Emotional
Stability, and GZTS Ojectivity (all measures of N); EPI E, MBTI Introversion-Extraversion,            and
GZTS Sociability (measures of E); and MBTI Sensation-Intuition           and SSS-V Experience Seeking
(measures of 0). These findings support the discriminant validity of the A and C scales with respect
to the other major factors.
   The first two columns in Table 3 compare correlations for the original 18-item NEO-PI A domain
scale and the revised 48-item A scale. The correlations are very similar, supporting the view that
the new scale retains the validity of the older scale. Both columns show clear evidence of convergent
validity of the A domain scales, the largest correlates being with ACL needs for Nurturance and
Deference, IAS-R Unassuming-Ingenuous vs Arrogant-Calculating             scales, and low BDHI Assault
and Verbal Hostility.
   In general, the revised scale shows larger correlations than the original (mean absolute r values
using z transformation are 0.38 and 0.35), but these modest improvements could not themselves
justify the increased length of the scale. The advantage of the NEO-PIR is the availability of
facet scales that measure distinct aspects of the broader domain. The remaining columns of
Table 3 give evidence of the validity-particularly     the discriminant validity-of    these facet scales.
Individuals scoring high in Trust are high in GZTS Personal Relations and low in Psychoticism
and especially BDHI Suspicion. High Straightforwardness             scores are particularly associated
with the Unassuming-Ingenuous        scale of the IAS-R, whereas low scores are associated with the
Arrogant-Calculating     scale and BDHI Indirect Hostility. Altruism is related to ACL Nurturance
and the IAS-R Warn-Agreeable        scale; Compliance is positively related to GZTS Friendliness and
ACL Deference, and negatively related to ACL Autonomy and Aggression and BDHI Assault and
Verbal Hostility. Individuals scoring high in Modesty are high in the need for Abasement and low
                                                          Facets of Agreeableness                  and Conscientiousness                                                                           895

in the need for Exhibition; IAS-R correlations suggest that they are unassuming rather than
arrogant. Finally, Tender-Mindedness        shows a distinctively large correlation with the MBTI
Thinking-Feeling scale, suggesting that high scorers are governed more by their feelings than
by cold logic. The cold-heartedness of low scorers is seen in the IAS-R correlates. The pattern
of correlations of all the scales support their convergent and discriminant validity; this is
particularly noteworthy for Compliance and Tender-Mindedness,              which have relatively low
internal consistencies.
   The first two columns of Table 4 provide evidence on the validity of the original and revised
C domain scales. Conceptually, the most relevant criteria in the table are ACL needs for
Achievement, Order, and Endurance; they are also the strongest empirical correlates. Across all
criteria, the revised scale shows stronger correlations than the original (mean absolute r = 0.36 and
0.31). Correlations of the criterion scales with the C facets show that Competence is associated with
IAS-R Assured-Dominant         and ACL needs for Achievement and (low) Succorance: competent
people are confident, accomplished, and able to take care of themselves. NEO-PIR Order is most
strongly related to ACL Order; it is also strongly related to the MBTI Judging-Perceiving scale,
which measures preference for structured vs spontaneous decision-making. Dutifulness is related
to ACL Order and Endurance; it also shows a distinctive negative correlation with SSS-V
Disinhibition, which is consistent with the view that this facet measures in part the restraining
influence of conscience. Achievement Striving is most highly related to ACL Achievement; it is also
related to GZTS General Activity. Self-Discipline is the best predictor of ACL Endurance among
the facet scales, and Deliberation is appropriately related to MBTI Judging-Perceiving, (low) ACL
Change, and GZTS Restraint.
   The many substantial correlations between facets of C and IAS-R scales are somewhat
surprising, because the interpersonal circumplex which the IAS-R measures is usually conceptualized

in terms of the two dimensions of E and A (McCrae & Costa, 1989). However, an earlier version of
the instrument (Wiggins, 1979) contrasted Ambitious-Dominant         with Submissive-Lazy, and the
correlations with the Achievement Striving facet scale suggest that elements of ambition vs laziness
remain in the revised Assured-Dominant        and Unassured-Submissive       scales, as seen in such
adjectives as firm and persistent. These associations are not artifactual; instead, they demonstrate
that traits in the domain of Conscientiousness have interpersonal implications. For example, indi-
viduals who are highly competent and driven to succeed are more likely to be the leaders of groups.
   Finally, intercorrelations  among the domain scales themselves were considered; these are
presented in Table 5. As in previous research (Costa & McCrae, 1989a), there was a moderately
large correlation between E and 0; there was also a substantial negative correlation between N
and C. None of the other cross-domain correlations exceeded 0.25 in absolute magnitude. It should
be noted in particular that the correlation between A and C is only 0.13; it is thus unlikely that
these two domains represent different aspects of a single broader factor such as Psychoticism
(McCrae & Costa, 1985a).

                                                    GENERAL                   DISCUSSION

  Although the need for scales measuring specific aspects of all five broad personality factors or
domains has been recognized for some time, no published instrument has so far provided such

scales. The Revised NE0 Personality Inventory (NEO-PIR) is intended to correct this problem by
offering six facet scales to measure each of the five domains. An analysis of the personality literature
was used to identify specific traits that appeared to be theoretically important, and scales were
created to operationalize these constructs. Item factor analyses in a large and diverse sample
suggested that the scales empirically reproduce the distinctions embodied in the facets, and factor
analyses of the scales clearly recovered the five-factor model itself. Studies of convergent and
discriminant validity with other self-report questionnaire scales in a second sample provided
supportive evidence for the new A and C facets.
   Previous studies of the NEO-PI have shown convergence across spouse and peer observers for
all five domains and for the facets of E, N, and 0 (e.g. Costa & McCrae, 1988). Future studies
should examine the cross-observer validity of the new A and C facets. In addition, studies of these
new facets in clinical samples would be especially valuable, both as part of the process of
generalizing validity across populations and as part of the continuing exploration of the utility of
the five-factor model in clinical psychology (e.g. Miller, in press). The analyses presented here
provide encouragment for such studies.
